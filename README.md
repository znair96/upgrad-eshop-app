Pointers for the project - 

1. Common components should be added in the common folder

2. Please make sure to add css along with component and cover it inside the folder corresponding to the components

3. All reducers should be made in reducers named folder and add the reducer inside store.js 

4. Please make the component as small as possible so it can be reused in other components.
